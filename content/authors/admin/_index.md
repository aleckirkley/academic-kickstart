I am a PhD candidate in the University of Michigan Physics Department, working with 
<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/">Mark Newman</a> on complex networks and statistical physics. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Rochester, and began my journey in complex systems working with <a href="http://gghoshal.pas.rochester.edu/">Gourab Ghoshal</a>. 

I am interested in a broad array of problems, including inference in network models, social network dynamics, urban mobility, socioeconomic inequality, and fast algorithms for analyzing statistical physics systems. My research involves a balance of mathematical theory, computer simulation, and analysis of empirical data. I am fortunate to be supported by an <a href="https://ndseg.sysplus.com/">NDSEG Fellowship</a> through the Department of Defense, and I am also a recipient of the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>.
